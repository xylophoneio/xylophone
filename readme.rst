What is Xylophone
###################

Xylophone is a fork of `CodeIgniter<http://codeigniter.com/>`_ designed to improve upon the release cycle
and drivers/libraries that otherwise wouldn't make it into the official release
while still having the ability to take security/performance updates from CodeIgniter
and dropping the support for PHP 5.2.x.

The aim is to provide existing applications and upgrade path while implementing new features
like HMVC, further tightened consistencies and overall, making it easier to work with.

Acknowledgement
***************

We'd like to thank the team at EllisLab's for creating CodeIgniter for which
we would have no foundation to build upon - we're hoping to attract the same
amazing community that CI did for Xylophone - we welcome and look forward to
all support and code driven by the community.
